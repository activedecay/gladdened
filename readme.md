# gladdened
I'm just happy to get a triangle on the screen.

This project is sort of a minimal playground to mess around with OpenGL.

# glad
The `glad/` directory is a clone from github.com's glad

# glfw
The `glfw/` directory is a clone from github.com's glfw

# requirements
linux, opengl, cmake, clone glad and glfw in the directories above.

# build
Building is easy with CLion, but I think you'd just do this:

    mkdir cmake-build-debug && cmake ..
    make
